Not a complete game!

I have not dabbled in writing any videogame-related code since before the advent of GPUs.

Therefore, my goal here was to apply very old, single-threaded principles to writing a naive game loop, in a functional manner.

Think of this as the first thing someone who has not written videogame code in years, and is at best an enthusiastic FP implementer,
 would commit. No optimization whatsoever since this is our first draft.

 Hopefully, curious Reason Native devs will find some amusement in this.
